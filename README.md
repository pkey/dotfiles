# Paulius' .dotfiles :wrench:

## Getting started :rocket:

1. `git clone git@github.com:pkey/.dotfiles.git` to your home folder. Everything should end up in `~/.dotfiles`.
2. `sh ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh`
3. Let it fly

## Environment

`.env` file might be used to define the environment variables:

- **Workspace**: defines workspace in which terminal operates. Possible values: Personal, Swedbank
